# Gamehacking.Academy but made with Rust
The first few "hacks" made target a game called "The Battle for Wesnoth" mainly version 1.14.9 - so they might not work if you are testing this locally on a different version

Note; the game runs on 32bit so for the "hack" tool to work properly you also should run it on 32bit

## ExternalMemoryHack
this contains one of the first "hacks" made
Using winapi to hook into the process and edit the value of how much gold the player has.

## DLLMemoryHack
This one is still a WIP.
